# RPS-MULTIPLAYER

## Click the link! Must have two players in order to play.
[Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://jmichael96.github.io/RPS-MULTIPLAYER/)

## HOW IT WORKS
  Firebase is used to store all the data being implemented by the user. The name, chat and users selection (RPS) 
  is stored until the user leaves the page. The wins, losses and ties are also stored in firebase until the user exits the web page.
  JQuery is used to render all the information that the user selects or inputs to the html along with initiating functions.

## RULES:
Enter your name to get started! Once your opponent enters their name, one of the game panels will turn green which will prompt the player to choose Rock, Paper, or scissors. When your opponent selects their object you will be notified with a win, loss, or tie! 
A chat box is also available to communicate to your competitor.
Good luck and have fun! :)
