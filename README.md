## RULES:
Enter your name to get started! Once your opponent enters their name, one of the game panels will turn green which will prompt the player to choose Rock, Paper, or scissors. When your opponent selects their object you will be notified with a win, loss, or tie! 
A chat box is also available to communicate to your competitor.
Good luck and have fun! :)
